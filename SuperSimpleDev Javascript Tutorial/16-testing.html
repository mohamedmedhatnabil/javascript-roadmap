        /* - the first type of testing is manual test where we test every thing on our website it's hard to test
        every test case and hard to re-test when you change something in your code
        - we have another type called automated test where we write code to test code
        in the automated test we have 2 types of test cases 1- basic test case = tests if the
        code is working or not 
        2- edge test case(if there are any) = means that we test the code with values that are a little bit tricky tehr're on the edge 
        of what our code can handle
        - we should try something different for every test case
        - a group of related test cases = test suite
